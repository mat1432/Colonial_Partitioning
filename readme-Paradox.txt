### Though the project title is 'Colonial_Partitioning' the Steam download has the mod name 'colonial_fixes' as a relic from this mod's early development!

[B]1.34.* ; This Mod Does Not Need to be Updated![/B]

This mod allows you to strip away all provinces any of your colonies has, that is in a colony charter outside their capital charter!
No more Brazil and Colombia completely colonizing Peru on an ironman save, you can just strip the lands to your possession and then unpause to create Colonial Peru!

This Mod is completely dynamic and should be compatible with just about every major map mod! Yes, it works on Random New Worlds, Anbennar, BT, Ante Bellum, etc.

This is a cheat mod, but I've included some settings so that it's less cheaty and more like gaming the system.
An event will fire at the start of the game to specify if you want to enable cheaty options.
